This repository has been archived as the code has been migrated to the
[ml-gradle repository](https://github.com/marklogic/ml-gradle/tree/dev/ml-app-deployer) as part of the
ml-gradle 5.0.0 release.

The [Wiki pages in this repository](https://github.com/marklogic/ml-app-deployer/wiki) are still valid as
documentation but may soon be folded into the ml-gradle documentation.
